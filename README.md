## Table of Contents
- Data Communications

> Computer Networks: Combination of Hardware, and Software that sends data from one location to another.
> Software: Instruction sets/ programs/ computers/ devices/ notes.

> Data and Informaiton: Raw facts and figures is called data.
> 
> Information: Meaningful & processed data is called information.

### Data communication is judged on four parameters: 
* **Delivery** : correct destination while delivering data.
* **Accuracy** : Data is not changing, or altered. (Data packets should reach as it is)
* **Timeliness**: The system muswt deliver data in a timely manner, Data delivered late is useless.
* **Jitter**: Variation in packet arrival time. i.e, Uneven Delay.

### Components in Computer Networks: 
* **Sender** : Device sending Data
* **Reciever** : Device recieving data
* **Message**: Data being shared is called message
* **Transmission Medium**: Pysical path by which message is being shared, i.e, sent or recieved.
* **Protocols**: Set of rules, governing data communication, and is an angreement between the communicating devices.
